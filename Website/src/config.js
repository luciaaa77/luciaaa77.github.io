The Government will structure its ongoing response around four principles: a. Living with COVID-19: removing restrictions while encouraging safer behaviours through public health advice. b. Protecting the most vulnerable people based on JCVI guidance; c. Maintaining resilience; d.

            description: 'Throughout the pandemic since 2020, instead of a hard lockdown, the Japanese government choose to declare a ‘state of emergency’ every when the virus waves become served. The state of emergency does not imply a complete lockdown like in other nations, but it does place limitations on "non-essential" activities like travel and dining out. Depending on the situation, the time and scale of the ‘emergency states’ are also different. The Japanese policy has been considered a ‘loose’ type, compared to UK and Australia. The declaration empowers prefectural governors in impacted areas to "suggest" that citizens remain at home except for needed duties. Anything judged vital to maintaining life, such as going to the hospital, buying food, and commuting to work, are considered essential chores. Future trend: Although there’s no public announcement such as ‘living with the virus’ has been announced officially. Public leaders ranging from Tokyos governor to former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe have expressed support for reducing the virus legal status in Japan, citing evidence that shows omicron poses a lower risk than prior strains. Patients would have more access to health care as a result of the modification, which basically makes the virus look like the flu.',
